# JsRoutesWatcher
Plugin for *Ruby on Rails* which utilise [js-routes](https://github.com/railsware/js-routes) gem to work with **webpacker**.

Using modern JS-frameworks such as **Vue** or **React**, you have to move all rails-generated routes to javascript.
Then you'll be able to do this:
```javascript
const login_path = Routes.api_login_path()
```

[js-routes](https://github.com/railsware/js-routes) gem give you the ability to export rails routes to js file. 

But how to do this automatically? There's gem you're watching on comes to play.

Every time when `config/routes.rb` is updated `Guard` task will regenerate `app/javascript/packs/routes.js` file. And all you have to do â€“ is to import it in your project js-packs.
```javascript
import './routes.js'
// Then
Routes.api_login_path()
```
